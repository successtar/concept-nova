## Summary

As a kid, I was fascinated about privacy and encryption. It lead me to create my own ciphered language. To encipher a word, I would apply the following rules for every letter in a word:

First, all letters are changed to lowercase

The letter “a” will become “e”, and vice versa

The letter “o” will become “u”, and vice versa

The letter “p” will become “b”, and vice versa

The letter “t” will become “d”, and vice versa

The letter “s” will become “c”, and vice versa

The letter “j” will become “g”, and vice versa

The letter “m” will become “n”, and vice versa

Every two consecutive letters will become a single uppercase of that letter first, and then encrypted if necessary

## Your Task

Your task will be to write two functions in any language of your choice.

The first function will take a word or sentence as an argument, and return them in an enciphered form, using the rules above.

The second function will take a ciphered word or sentence as an argument, and return the deciphered form, using the rules above.
Examples

If we feed the following into your function “I am going to school”, it should output the following “i en juimj du cshOl”. Other examples are as follows:

Man = nem

Pool = bOl

Spoon = cbOm

Elephant = alabhemd

Adam = eten

Lamp = lenb

Hypertext Markup Language = hybardaxd nerkob lemjoeja

Commitment = suNidnamd

Success = coSaC
